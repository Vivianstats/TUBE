Description: To bridge cost-sensitive and Neyman-Pearson paradigms for asymmetric binary classification, we have developed two algorithms, TUBEc and TUBE (estimating the Type I error Upper Bound of a cost-sensitive classifiEr). This package contains functions of TUBE-assisted and TUBEc-assisted cost-sensitive classification methods for selecting the type I error cost so that the resulting cost-sensitive classifier has its population type I error under a target upper bound with high probability.
